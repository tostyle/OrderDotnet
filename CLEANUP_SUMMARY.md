# MediatR Cleanup - Completed ✅

## Summary of Changes

The project has been successfully cleaned up by removing all MediatR-related components and simplifying the architecture to use direct service injection.

## What Was Removed

### 1. **All Endpoints from Controller** ✅
- Removed all HTTP endpoints from `OrdersController`
- Controller is now empty but still functional
- Only basic logger injection remains

### 2. **Commands and Queries** ✅
- Deleted entire `/Application/Commands/` directory
- Deleted entire `/Application/Queries/` directory
- Removed all command and query classes

### 3. **Handlers** ✅
- Deleted entire `/Application/Handlers/` directory
- Removed all command handlers and query handlers

### 4. **OrderApplicationService** ✅
- Removed `OrderApplicationService.cs` and its interface
- This was the MediatR-based service wrapper

### 5. **Validators** ✅
- Deleted entire `/Application/Validators/` directory
- Removed FluentValidation validators for commands/queries

### 6. **MediatR Package References** ✅
- Removed MediatR from `Application.csproj`
- Removed MediatR from `Api.csproj`
- Removed MediatR.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection

### 7. **FluentValidation** ✅
- Removed FluentValidation from `Application.csproj`
- Removed FluentValidation.DependencyInjectionExtensions from `Api.csproj`

### 8. **Program.cs Cleanup** ✅
- Removed MediatR service registration
- Removed FluentValidation registration
- Simplified to only register `OrderService` directly
- Updated startup logging messages

## What Remains (Clean Architecture)

### Application Layer
- **`OrderService`** - Main application service with business operations
- **DTOs** - Data transfer objects for service communication
- **Extensions** - Mapping and extension methods

### Domain Layer
- **Entities** - Order, OrderPayment, OrderLoyalty, OrderStock
- **Value Objects** - OrderId, PaymentMethod, etc.
- **Aggregates** - OrderAggregate with business logic
- **Repositories** - Interface definitions

### Infrastructure Layer
- **Repositories** - Concrete implementations
- **Configurations** - EF Core configurations
- **Data Context** - Database context

### API Layer
- **Controllers** - Empty controller (ready for new endpoints)
- **Program.cs** - Simplified startup with direct service injection

### Tests
- **Unit Tests** - OrderServiceTests with mocked repositories
- All tests pass ✅

## Project Status

✅ **Builds Successfully** - No compilation errors  
✅ **Tests Pass** - All 5 unit tests passing  
✅ **Clean Architecture Maintained** - Proper separation of concerns  
✅ **No MediatR Dependencies** - Completely removed  
✅ **Simplified DI** - Direct service injection only  

## Next Steps

The project is now ready for:
1. **Adding new endpoints** to the controller with direct `OrderService` injection
2. **Extending business logic** in the domain layer
3. **Adding more unit tests** for additional scenarios
4. **Integration tests** if needed

The architecture is now simpler and more direct while maintaining clean architecture principles.
