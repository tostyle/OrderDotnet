# Instructions for Copilot
- Use the provided prefix and suffix code snippets to complete the code.
- Ensure that the code is modular and follows SOLID principles
- Use appropriate naming conventions for classes, methods, and variables
- Include comments to explain complex logic or important decisions
- Write unit tests for critical components
- Use dependency injection for better testability and maintainability
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to avoid code duplication
- Ensure that the code is well-structured and easy to read
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations where applicable
- Handle exceptions gracefully and log errors appropriately
- Use appropriate design patterns where applicable (e.g., Repository, Factory, etc.)
- Ensure that the code is compatible with .NET 6 or later
- Use modern C# features (e.g., records, pattern matching) where appropriate
- Ensure that the code is secure and follows best practices for security
- Use appropriate namespaces and folder structure to organize the code
- Ensure that the code is performant and optimized for speed
- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms for the task at hand
- Ensure that the code is scalable and can handle increased load
- Use appropriate logging and monitoring to track application performance and errors    
- Use Entity Framework Core for data access    
- Use Temporal for workflow management
- Use Extension methods for reusable functionality
- Use FluentValidation for input validation
- Use Opentelemetry for distributed tracing, metrics, and logging
- Domain should be pure and not depend on any external libraries
